plusminus Change Log

0.1.2 -

    - Updated the values returned from evaluating an assignment
      expression. If a single value is assigned, then a single
      value is returned. If multiple values are assigned, a tuple
      of the values is returned. (Previously, the underlying
      list of values was returned.)

    - Guard against overly-nested ()'s (10 levels is the max).

    - New unit tests, thanks toonarmycaptain!


0.1.1 -

    - Added useful customization methods to public API
      - safe_pow
      - safe_str_mult
      - constrained_factorial
      - ArithmeticParseException

    - Modified example parsers to use these safe methods

    - Moved many functions out of the base ArithmeticParser class and into
      BasicArithmeticParser, so that applications can choose to extend
      from the base class if trigonometric, etc. functions are not
      relevant to their particular domain.

    - Moved example parsers into plusminus import tree, so that they can be
      imported and used:

          from plusminus.examples.example_parsers import DiceRollParser

          parser = DiceRollParser()
          print(parser.evaluate("3d20")

    - Moved body of usage() out of bottle_repl and into the parser class
      itself so that repls can get basic usage text directly from the parser.
